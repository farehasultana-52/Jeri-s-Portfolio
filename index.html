            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>Jerry is usually described as an excited, carefree and cheeky mouse, he in several episodes is shown to be cold as he seeks to have fun no matter who he harms, which to Tom's anger his sense of fun is sadistic, but he also has other targets although Tom is the main one among them, but this last characteristic seems to have a limit as in the episode "The Lonesome Mouse" he regrets having set up Tom to be kicked out of the house. Also Jerry gets Tom in trouble by the humans, who sometimes doesn’t see Jerry because he’s small.</p>
