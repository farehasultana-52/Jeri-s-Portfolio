            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>Jerry is usually described as an excited, carefree and cheeky mouse, he in several episodes is shown to be cold as he seeks to have fun no matter who he harms, which to Tom's anger his sense of fun is sadistic, but he also has other targets although Tom is the main one among them, but this last characteristic seems to have a limit as in the episode "The Lonesome Mouse" he regrets having set up Tom to be kicked out of the house. Also Jerry gets Tom in trouble by the humans, who sometimes doesn’t see Jerry because he’s small.</p>

                <h3>Tom Cat</h3>
            <p>In a number of episodes, Jerry gains an advantage against Tom the Cat. Tom can also overcome Jerry at times, but Jerry nearly always gets his vengeance on Tom. However, in other situations, Tom wins the episode while Jerry loses, implying that Jerry is vulnerable to Tom.</p>

                <h3>The Three Kittens</h3>
                <p>Jerry gets overwhelmed by the three kittens in the episode "Triplet Trouble." Those three are far more effective at keeping Jerry at bay than Tom, but in the end, Tom and Jerry join forces to put a stop to the triplets' antics.</p>
